# Chess
I was tasked with implementing chess for my Python class as a final project.

## Features
- an object oriented solution
- a visual interface made with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
- a way to play locally against another player
- a simple AI that makes random but correct moves
#### Usage
```sh
python chess.py <PVP/AI>
```
